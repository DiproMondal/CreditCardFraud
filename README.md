Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Background :
Credit Card Fraud detection is a very sophisticated project in finacnial industry. With advancements in Machine Learning people have found models which can predict credit card fraud detection with good accuracy, but there is always a push to refine those models in order to increase accuracy.
This project describes a simple approach which highly increases the accuracy. Initially a comparative study has been done with a few models and then a model has been developed with linear combition of the predictions which (according to the dataset) provides an 100% accuracy. Though the claim of such accuracy cannot be established with such limited data and few models, but this gives a direction in model development for credit card fraud detection.
